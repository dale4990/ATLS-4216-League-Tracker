            ARAM, abbreviation of All Random, All Mid, is a game mode in League of Legends in a 5v5 format on the Howling Abyss icon Howling Abyss, 
            where the objective is to destroy the opposing team's Nexus. The game includes an Reroll All random draft type, and a game that takes place only on one long lane 
            (specifically referencing its resemblance to Summoner's Rift icon Summoner's Rift's middle lane).
            In ARAM, players are given random champions from the available champion pool and are able to trade or reroll their picks.
