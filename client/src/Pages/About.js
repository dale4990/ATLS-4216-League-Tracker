          <h3>Dorjee Zhang</h3>
          <h4>CS(BS) + Sophomore + Frontend</h4>
          <p>Born in Honolulu Hawaii and a 13 year resident of Colorado, Dorjee spent his early days dabbling into games on his Nintendo 3DS. He would grow up to love Pokemon (Genesect and Greninja are his favorites) and Plants Vs. Zombies.
            He would get his first introduction to computer science during quarantine, when he came across the API for discord, an instant messaging social media platform. Dorjee would also begin playing League of Legends during the beginning
             of quarantine, resulting in a modern day addiction. In his free time, Dorjee enjoys reading stoic literature, going on walks, hitting the gym, and sleeping.

          <h3>Daniel Lee</h3>
          <h4>ECE(BS) + Senior + Full-Stack</h4>
          <p>Native born and raised in Colorado, Daniel has the native hiking blood in him. Spending his early days dabbling into SUPERCELL and .io games, Daniel would grow quite fond of video games. Once the quarantine days began, Daniel would 
            spend much of his time playing League of Legends, watching Clone Wars, and focusing on school. Daniel grew quite fond of computers, and, after entering college as an Electrical Engineer major, he decided to pick up a computer science 
            minor as well. Computer Systems (CSCI 2400) would bode his most difficult class. In his free time, Daniel enjoys playing League, making beats, and watching anime.
